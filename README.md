# ComfyUI Tetris
The primitive node and dummy input are required because comfy doesn't accept requests with identical graphs. You'll also need a show text node. I like the one from [ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts](https://github.com/pythongosssss/ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts). I got the generic tetris remake from claude so it may or may not be ripped from somewhere else.
